  If you want to see the project working on your machine,
  simply you need to open the folder of the project, then use the terminal of your Operational Sytem or your preffered IDE,
  type <strong>npm start</strong>, it will work fine.
  <br />
  <em>Don't forget to run <strong>npm install</strong> before.</em>

## Create a production build of the application
<p>
  When it comes to create a build version of the React app,
  just run the following command on your terminal <strong>npm run build</strong>,
  don't forget that you need to run the command inside your project's folder. ðŸ˜‰
  <br />
  After running the command, you will see a folder called "build", use that to publish the application.
